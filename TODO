Short term :
- rewriting wait in kernel/task
- cleaning defines 
- including header files in .S files
- locking @ inode level  

Long term :	
- implementing useful system calls 
- code reorg:
- init functions streamlining
- enhancing debugging,logging and shell features 	

Running Linux program:
- syscalls proper implementation as linux and adding any syscall related fs

---------------------------------------------------------
fixes:
 1) when system call number more then max limit, raising pagefault
 2) argv strings in sys_execve should be multiples of 8 , otherwise stack pointer is not getting the multiples of 8

------------------------------
p9 :
  - unhandled interrupt-15
  - fseek, stats, close, closing fids, 
  - interpreting qid 
----------------------------------  

 for executing userland program(busybox ):
1) pagecache: freeing and allocating pagecache page by incrementing/decrementing usage count.
2) fs_seek in loading elf not implemented
3) while mapping stack address hardcoded, it may collide with other maps in user program
4) while reading the file contents, getting stuck @ paging.c:468
5) fs segment register is currently used only for user application, during app switching the content should be modified in schedule function
6) clearing all data when user thread exit.
7) running two or more userlevel threads
