URGENT:
   when schedule is called from do_exit or any other function, at the same time schedule may be called from timer interrupt, this need to avoided by some means.

Basic:
1) Page cache Implemenatation & Host FS

2) ELF interpretation and loading the program

3) User level code & system calls
	
4) code reorg:
	
Urgent:  cleanup the display.c with sti and cli commands, scroll .
---------------------------------------------------------

Advanced:
1. VFS layer + Para virtualised Filsystem layer: 
	a) defining the VFS interface.
	b) defining a small para virtualised file system.
2. elf binary interepreter:
	a) interpreting the elf binary
	b) hooking to the OS environment.
3. system interface layer for the user level code to run:
4. Misc:
	a) implementing tickless timer interrupt .
