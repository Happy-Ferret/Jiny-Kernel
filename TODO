URGENT:
   when schedule is called from do_exit or any other function, at the same time schedule may be called from timer interrupt, this need to avoided by some means.

Basic:
1. scheduler improvement:
	a) exit method.
	b) proper bottom-half handling and schedule method calling from interrupt.

2. mm improvement: 
	a) kmalloc.
	b) virtual address @ non-zero
	
3. code reorg:
	a) defining the interface between mm/kernel/arch.
	
4. Improving the command line:
	a) shell improvement, 
	c) display,
	
5. misc:
	a) stats:  scheduler

Urgent:  cleanup the display.c with sti and cli commands, scroll .
---------------------------------------------------------

Advanced:
1. VFS layer + Para virtualised Filsystem layer: 
	a) defining the VFS interface.
	b) defining a small para virtualised file system.
2. elf binary interepreter:
	a) interpreting the elf binary
	b) hooking to the OS environment.
3. system interface layer for the user level code to run:
4. Misc:
	a) implementing tickless timer interrupt .
