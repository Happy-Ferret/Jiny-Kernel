Short term :

- rewriting wait in kernel/task
- cleaning defines 
- including header files in .S files


Long term :	
- implementing useful system calls 
- code reorg:
- init functions streamlining
- enhancing debugging,logging and shell features 	

---------------------------------------------------------
fixes:
 1) when system call number more then max limit, raising pagefault
 2) in elf interpretation the first function is interpreted as first function
