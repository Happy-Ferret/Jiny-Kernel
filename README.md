## JINY : Jana's tINY kernel
 [JINY] is designed from ground up for superior performance on virtual machine.

1. WHAT IS JINY?.
- Jiny is a tiny unix like kernel, linux app can run directly on it without recompiling because Jiny provides system call interface same or subset of linux. 
- Designed from ground up for vm: It is designed from the ground up to give superior performance on vm. The performance gain will come from reducing memory and cpu overhead when compare to traditional os like linux,freebsd etc.
- High priority versus normal priority apps: The apps running on Jiny OS are divided in to high priority and normal priority. The high priority app like JVM,memcached can run faster when compare to the same app in linux vm. High priority app can sometimes run faster then the same app on teh metal.
- The number of high priority app's to run will be restricted 1 or 2 at any time because they will be running in kernel context with the same address space as that of user level app. Normal priority app's  will not be recompiled and not limited in number, the performance will be similar to that of Linux. High priority app need to recompile but change in code is not required.

2. What is the development plan and current status?.
  Phase-1: Developing traditional unix like kernel with small foot print(Completed)
   a) bringing kernel up on x86_64 without any user level app.
   b) Implementing most of the linux system calls, so that statically compiled app's on linux can run as it is. Currently app's like busybox can run as it is.
    
  phase-2: Changing kernel to run high priority app in kernel context(In Progress)
   a) Changes in Jiny to support high priority app with superior performance when compare to linux vm.
      - to run the high priority app in the kernel context, this is to reduce the memory overhead. Tunning VM and task schedular layer's to support high priority tasks.
      - to disable/minimize the interrupts on the cpu that is loaded with high priority app. this is reduce the cpu overhead and locks.
   b) converting most of subsytems from c to c++11.
     
3. For What purpose Jiny can be used?
In the Past, it was used for:
	a) To model the page cache(MRU+LRU) suitable for hadoop like applications.
	b) To model Host based filesystem(HFS): HFS is filesystem run in guest OS but does file i/o using the shared memory between the guest and host os. HFS does not need any block drivers, it communicated with block devices using the shared memory between guest and host OS.  
	c) Benchmarking virtio net performance.
	
In the future, it can be used run single high priority app in a vm:
    a) running specialized high priority app like  JVM(hadoop,or any java server), memcached  etc. 

4. ON WHAT HARDWARE DOES IT RUN?
 It was fully tested for x86_64. partially done for x86_32.
 
##Benchmark:
- app as high priority in Jiny VM:    6 sec
- app as normal priority in Jiny VM: 55 sec
- same app on the metal(linux host): 44 sec
- same app on the linux vm:          43 sec

App in VM performance/throughput is better then same app on metal:

From cpu core point of view: 
- when app is running in jiny vm, virtualization hardware is active and it will protect rest of resource  from malfunctioning the app.
             means if the app crashes it will not bring the host down, but only the vm crashes.
        when app is directly on the metal, virtualization hardware is passive/disabled and the os sorrounding will make sure that the malfunctioning of the app will not bring down the host.
        so in the first case hardware is helping to protect from app malfunction, in the second case software(host os) will protect the app malfunctioning.
         Here OS protection means, app running in ring-3 and enters in to ring-0 using  syscall and there will copy of parameters and validations. All this is not needed in the first case. Since there is no such protecton in Jiny High priority app, this will increase the efficiency of syscalls and context switches.
        
- From end user point of view: The same app just recompiled to run in  Jiny as high priority task. The app need to be launched though vm.
  Why do the recompilation needed: The app will be running the kernel context, so the syscall located in libc will replaced with corresponding function calls, The app will be running in ring-0 same as that of kernel.

 conclusion: virtulization hardware can also be used to speedup the app.
